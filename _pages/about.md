I am working with Dr. José L. Gómez at Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, IAA - CSIC, Granada, Spain for my Master’s Thesis for the academic year 2021-2022. The aim of the thesis is to determine the magnetic field structure of relativistic jets of supermassive black holes by doing Faraday rotation analysis of multi-frequency VLBA polarimetric data. The project is funded by JAE Intro 2021 Scholarship by CSIC, Spain.

Research Interests
======

My research interests include Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Jets in AGN, VLBI imaging, Blazars, Quasars and NLS1 galaxies. In particular, I am interested in studying how jets in AGN are formed, what their magnetic field structure is and how it affects the jet formation. I am curious to find out how these jets stay collimated at large scales. I want to focus on these questions by analysing and studying radio observations. I also intend to learn and perform simulations of the jets to compare them with the observations.

I am looking for Fall 2022 PhD positions in these domains.
