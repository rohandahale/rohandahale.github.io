Hi! I am a "la Caixa" PhD Candidate in the [VLBI Group](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es){:target="_blank"} led by with Dr. José L. Gómez at Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA - CSIC), Granada, Spain.

My research focuses on black hole accretion and relativistic jet formation through very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations with mm-wave arrays, such as the [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/){:target="_blank"}, [GMVA](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/vlbi/globalmm/){:target="_blank"}, and the space VLBI missions like [RadioAstron](http://www.asc.rssi.ru/radioastron/){:target="_blank"}. I am focused on using Bayesian imaging and modeling methods to analyze these observations. I am also keen to contribute to developing multi-frequency imaging method using Bayesian parameter estimation.

Before joining IAA, I graduated with a Bachelor's and Master's in Physical Sciences from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/#gsc.tab=0){:target="_blank"} in July 2022. For my Master's thesis, I started working with Dr. Gómez during the academic year 2021-2022 to study relativistic jets of supermassive black holes by analyzing multi-frequency VLBA polarimetric observations. I am honored to get funding for this project through the JAE-Intro Scholarship by CSIC, Spain. During my undergraduate years, I worked with [Dr. Emilia Järvelä](https://www.ou.edu/cas/physics-astronomy/people/directory/post-docs/emilia-jarvela){:target="_blank"} at ESA to study radio emission from narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. I also worked with [Prof. Robert Antonucci](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/people/robert-antonucci){:target="_blank"} at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to study the polarization properties of quasars and radio galaxies.
