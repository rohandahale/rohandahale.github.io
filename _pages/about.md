I am working with Dr. José L. Gómez at Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, IAA - CSIC, Granada, Spain for my Master’s Thesis for the academic year 2021-2022. I am doing Faraday rotation analysis of relativistic jets of supermassive black holes to study their magnetic field structure using VLBA.

Research Interests
======

My research interests are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Jets in AGN, Quasars, BL Lac Objects, narrow-line Seyfert I galaxies, Polarimetry. In particular, I am interested in probing the jet physics in AGN. How are relativistic jets formed? What causes a powerful jet to be launched? How do jets keep their pointing direction fixed over large distances? How do they interact with the environment? What is their magnetic field structure? In my undergraduate and graduate research, I intend to focus on these questions by studying multi-wavelength observations and by doing GRMHD simulations to compare them with the observations.
