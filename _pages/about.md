I am working with Dr. José L. Gómez in the [VLBI Group](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es) at Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, IAA - CSIC, Granada, Spain for my Master’s Thesis for the academic year 2021-2022. The aim of the thesis is to determine the magnetic field structure of relativistic jets of supermassive black holes by analysing multi-frequency VLBA polarimetric observations. The project is funded by JAE Intro 2021 Scholarship by CSIC, Spain.

## Research Interests

I am interested in studying black hole accretion and relativistic jet formation through very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations with mm-wave arrays, such as the [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/), and the space VLBI missions like [RadioAstron](http://www.asc.rssi.ru/radioastron/). I intend to focus on RML Imaging Methods and Dynamical Imaging for the analysis of these observations during my PhD.

In particular, I am interested in studying how jets are launched, what their magnetic field structure is and how it affects the jet formation. I am curious to find out how these jets stay collimated at large scales. I am also keen on learning synthetic data generation and performing simulations of the jets to compare them with the observations.
