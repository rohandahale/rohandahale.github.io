I am working with Dr. José L. Gómez in the [VLBI Group](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es){:target="_blank"} at Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, IAA - CSIC, Granada, Spain for my PhD. My research focuses on black hole accretion and relativistic jet formation through very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations with mm-wave arrays, such as the [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/){:target="_blank"}, [GMVA](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/vlbi/globalmm/){:target="_blank"} and the space VLBI missions like [RadioAstron](http://www.asc.rssi.ru/radioastron/){:target="_blank"}. 

For my PhD, I am focused on using RML imaging methods and dynamical imaging for the analysis of these observations. I am also keen to contribute in developing modeling and imaging methods for time-variation using Bayesian parameter estimation for the EHT. Moreover, I plan on learning synthetic data generation techniques and performing simulations of the jets to compare them with the observations.

Prior to joining IAA, I graduated with a Bachelor and Master in Physical Sciences from [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/#gsc.tab=0){:target="_blank"} in May 2022. For my Master thesis, I started working with Dr. Gómez for my Master’s Thesis during the academic year 2021-2022 to study relativistic jets of supermassive black holes by analysing multi-frequency VLBA polarimetric observations. I am honored to get funding for this project through the prestigious JAE Intro Scholarship by CSIC, Spain. During my undergraduate years, I worked with with [Dr. Emilia Järvelä](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/personal-profiles/emilia-jarvela){:target="_blank"} at ESA to study radio emission from narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. I also worked with [Prof. Robert Antonucci](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/people/robert-antonucci){:target="_blank"} at University of California, Santa Barbara to study polarization properties of quasars and radio galaxies.
